    <h3>March 24, 2021</h3>

    <p>egnite, Inc. (“egnite,” “our,” or “we”) is committed to protecting the privacy and privacy choices of those who
      make use of our services and others whose Personal Data we receive. This Privacy Statement describes our policies
      and practices on the collection, use, and storage of information on the eHeatmap Power BI Visual (“Visual”), and
      also applies to Personal Information which we obtain and process other than through the Visual (for example,
      personal information about our end-users, vendors or service providers in the course of usage). </p>

    <p>We reserve the right to make changes to this Policy at any given time. If you want to make sure that you are up
      to date with the latest changes, we advise you to frequently visit this page. If at any point in time egnite
      decides to make use of any personally identifiable information on file, in a manner vastly different from that
      which was stated when this information was initially collected, the user or users shall be promptly notified by
      email. Users at that time shall have the option as to whether to permit the use of their information in this
      separate manner.</p>

    <p>This Policy applies to egnite, and it governs any and all data collection and usage by us. Through the use of the
      eHeatmap Power BI Visual, you are therefore consenting to the data collection procedures expressed in this Policy.
    </p>

    <p>Please note that this Policy does not govern the collection and use of information by companies that egnite does
      not control, nor by individuals not employed or managed by us. If you visit a website that we mention or link to,
      be sure to review its privacy policy before providing the site with information. It is highly recommended and
      suggested that you review the privacy policies and statements of any website you choose to use or frequent to
      better understand the way in which websites garner, make use of and share the information collected.</p>

    <p>Specifically, this Policy will inform you of the following</p>
    <ol>
      <li>What personally identifiable information is collected from you through our visual;</li>
      <li>What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data; and</li>
      <li>The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Information We Collect</strong></p>

    <p>We have designed our Visual so that users may use the Visual without providing any personal information to us.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Non-Marketing Purposes</strong></p>

    <p>egnite greatly respects your privacy. We do maintain and reserve the right to contact you if needed for
      non-marketing purposes (such as bug alerts, security breaches, account issues, and/or changes in egnite products
      and services). In certain circumstances, we may use our website, newspapers, or other public means to post a
      notice.</p>

    <p><strong>Notice to European Union Users</strong></p>

    <p>egnite's operations are located primarily in the United States. If you provide information to us, the information
      will be transferred out of the European Union (EU) and sent to the United States. (The adequacy decision on the
      EU-US Privacy became operational on August 1, 2016. This framework protects the fundamental rights of anyone in
      the EU whose personal data is transferred to the United States for commercial purposes. It allows the free
      transfer of data to companies that are certified in the US under the Privacy Shield.) By providing personal
      information to us, you are consenting to its storage and use as described in this Policy.</p>

    <p><strong>Security</strong></p>

    <p>The company uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) for authentication and private communications to build users' trust
      and confidence in the internet and website use by providing simple and secure access and communication of credit
      card and personal information.</p>

    <p><strong>Acceptance of Terms</strong></p>

    <p>By using this Visual, you are hereby accepting the terms and conditions stipulated within the Privacy Policy
      Agreement. If you are not in agreement with our terms and conditions, then you should refrain from further use of
      our Visuals. In addition, your continued use of our Visual following the posting of any updates or changes to our
      terms and conditions shall mean that you agree and acceptance of such changes.</p>

    <p><strong>GDPR Disclosure:</strong> </p>
    <p> If you answered "yes" to the question Does your website comply with the General Data Protection Regulation
      ("GDPR")? then the Privacy Policy above includes language that is meant to account for such compliance.
      Nevertheless, in order to be fully compliant with GDPR regulations your company must fulfill other requirements
      such as: (i) doing an assessment of data processing activities to improve security; (ii) have a data processing
      agreement with any third party vendors; (iii) appoint a data protection officer for the company to monitor GDPR
      compliance; (iv) designate a representative based in the EU under certain circumstances; and (v) have a protocol
      in place to handle a potential data breach. For more details on how to make sure your company is fully compliant
      with GDPR, please visit the official website at https://gdpr.eu. FormSwift and its subsidiaries are in no way
      responsible for determining whether or not your company is in fact compliant with GDPR and takes no responsibility
      for the use you make of this Privacy Policy or for any potential liability your company may face in relation to
      any GDPR compliance issues.</p>

    <p><strong>COPPA Compliance Disclosure:</strong></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy presumes that your website is not directed at children under the age of 13 and does not
      knowingly collect personal identifiable information from them or allow others to do the same through your site. If
      this is not true for your website or online service and you do collect such information (or allow others to do
      so), please be aware that you must be compliant with all COPPA regulations and guidelines in order to avoid
      violations which could lead to law enforcement actions, including civil penalties. </p>

    <p>In order to be fully compliant with COPPA your website or online service must fulfill other requirements such as:
      (i) posting a privacy policy which describes not only your practices, but also the practices of any others
      collecting personal information on your site or service â for example, plug-ins or ad networks; (ii) include a
      prominent link to your privacy policy anywhere you collect personal information from children; (iii) include a
      description of parental rights (e.g. that you won't require a child to disclose more information than is
      reasonably necessary, that they can review their child's personal information, direct you to delete it, and refuse
      to allow any further collection or use of the child's information, and the procedures to exercise their rights);
      (iv) give parents "direct notice" of your information practices before collecting information from their children;
      and (v) obtain the parents' "verifiable consent" before collecting, using or disclosing personal information from
      a child. For more information on the definition of these terms and how to make sure your website or online service
      is fully compliant with COPPA please visit
      https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule-six-step-compliance.
      FormSwift and its subsidiaries are in no way responsible for determining whether or not your company is in fact
      compliant with COPPA and takes no responsibility for the use you make of this Privacy Policy or for any potential
      liability your company may face in relation to any COPPA compliance issues. </p>
