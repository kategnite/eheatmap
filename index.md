ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY AGREEMENT
 
March 24, 2021
 
egnite, Inc. (“egnite,” “our,” or “we”) is committed to protecting the privacy and privacy choices of those who make use of our services and others whose Personal Data we receive. This Privacy Statement describes our policies and practices on the collection, use, and storage of information on the eHeatmap Power BI Visual (“Visual”), and also applies to Personal Information which we obtain and process other than through the Visual (for example, personal information about our end-users, vendors or service providers in the course of usage).  
 
We reserve the right to make changes to this Policy at any given time. If you want to make sure that you are up to date with the latest changes, we advise you to frequently visit this page. If at any point in time egnite decides to make use of any personally identifiable information on file, in a manner vastly different from that which was stated when this information was initially collected, the user or users shall be promptly notified by email. Users at that time shall have the option as to whether to permit the use of their information in this separate manner.
 
This Policy applies to egnite, and it governs any and all data collection and usage by us. Through the use of the eHeatmap Power BI Visual, you are therefore consenting to the data collection procedures expressed in this Policy.
 
Please note that this Policy does not govern the collection and use of information by companies that egnite does not control, nor by individuals not employed or managed by us. If you visit a website that we mention or link to, be sure to review its privacy policy before providing the site with information. It is highly recommended and suggested that you review the privacy policies and statements of any website you choose to use or frequent to better understand the way in which websites garner, make use of and share the information collected.
 
Specifically, this Policy will inform you of the following
1.	What personally identifiable information is collected from you through our visual;
2.	Why we collect personally identifiable information and the legal basis for such collection;
3.	How we use the collected information and with whom it may be shared;
4.	What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data; and
5.	The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.
 
Information We Collect
 
We have designed our Visual so that users may use the Visual without providing any personal information to us.
 
Non-Marketing Purposes
 
egnite greatly respects your privacy. We do maintain and reserve the right to contact you if needed for non-marketing purposes (such as bug alerts, security breaches, account issues, and/or changes in egnite products and services).  In certain circumstances, we may use our website, newspapers, or other public means to post a notice.
 
Notice to European Union Users
 
egnite's operations are located primarily in the United States. If you provide information to us, the information will be transferred out of the European Union (EU) and sent to the United States. (The adequacy decision on the EU-US Privacy became operational on August 1, 2016. This framework protects the fundamental rights of anyone in the EU whose personal data is transferred to the United States for commercial purposes. It allows the free transfer of data to companies that are certified in the US under the Privacy Shield.) By providing personal information to us, you are consenting to its storage and use as described in this Policy.
 
Security 

The company uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) for authentication and private communications to build users' trust and confidence in the internet and website use by providing simple and secure access and communication of credit card and personal information.
 
Acceptance of Terms
 
By using this Visual, you are hereby accepting the terms and conditions stipulated within the Privacy Policy Agreement. If you are not in agreement with our terms and conditions, then you should refrain from further use of our Visuals. In addition, your continued use of our Visual following the posting of any updates or changes to our terms and conditions shall mean that you agree and acceptance of such changes.

COPPA Compliance Disclosure:
 
This Privacy Policy presumes that your website is not directed at children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from them or allow others to do the same through your site. If this is not true for your website or online service and you do collect such information (or allow others to do so), please be aware that you must be compliant with all COPPA regulations and guidelines in order to avoid violations which could lead to law enforcement actions, including civil penalties. 
 
In order to be fully compliant with COPPA your website or online service must fulfill other requirements such as: (i) posting a privacy policy which describes not only your practices, but also the practices of any others collecting personal information on your site or service â for example, plug-ins or ad networks; (ii) include a prominent link to your privacy policy anywhere you collect personal information from children; (iii) include a description of parental rights (e.g.  that you won't require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary, that they can review their child's personal information, direct you to delete it, and refuse to allow any further collection or use of the child's information, and the procedures to exercise their rights); (iv) give parents "direct notice" of your information practices before collecting information from their children; and (v) obtain the parents' "verifiable consent" before collecting, using or disclosing personal information from a child.
